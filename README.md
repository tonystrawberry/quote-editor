  Quote Editor (powered by Hotwire)
</h1>

[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/tonystrawberry/quote-editor/badge.svg)](https://coveralls.io/github/tonystrawberry/quote-editor)


This application is a simple quote editor that allows users to create, edit, and delete quotes. I followed the tutorial from [Hotrails](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) to build this application. The tutorial has been a great introduction to **Hotwire** and how to use it to make an **SPA with Rails without using JavaScript**.

## Setup ⚙️

```
  bundle install
  rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```

## Running the application 🚀

```
  bin/dev
```

## Running the tests 🧪

```
  bin/rails test:all
```
